<workflow>
This is the core rule file that defines the basic structure and behavior of the automated code audit system.
All other rules should follow these conventions:

1. Version Control
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Document all changes in CHANGELOG.md

2. File Organization
- Place all rules in .cursor/rules/
- Use consistent naming convention: {number}-{category}-{purpose}.mdc
- Numbers: 000-099 for core rules
         100-199 for environment rules
         200-299 for security rules
         300-399 for quality rules
         900-999 for workflow rules

3. Rule Structure
- Must have version and description
- Must specify globs for file matching
- Should include metadata
- Should specify triggers if automated

4. Automation Triggers
- on_file_open: Run when a file is opened
- on_file_save: Run when a file is saved
- on_project_open: Run when project is opened
- on_scan_complete: Run after scan completion

5. Documentation
- Each rule must be well documented
- Include examples where applicable
- Specify dependencies if any
