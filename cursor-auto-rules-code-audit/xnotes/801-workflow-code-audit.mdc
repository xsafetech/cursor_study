# Security Audit Workflow
Version: 1.0.0
Name: Security Audit Workflow
Description: Defines the complete security audit workflow and process automation
Globs: ["*"]
Triggers: ["on_project_open", "on_file_change"]
Metadata:
  Author: "Security Team"
  Category: "Workflow"
  Priority: "High"

<workflow>
This rule defines the complete security audit workflow process:

1. Initialization Phase
   - Environment verification (100-environment-check.mdc)
   - Project structure validation
   - Security tool availability check
   - Configuration validation

2. Static Analysis Phase
   - Code pattern matching
   - Security rule validation
   - Quality metrics collection
   - Dependency analysis

3. Dynamic Analysis Phase
   - API security testing
   - Authentication flow validation
   - Authorization check
   - Input validation testing

4. Reporting Phase
   - Vulnerability aggregation
   - Risk assessment
   - Report generation
   - Notification dispatch

5. Integration Points
   - Issue tracker integration
   - CI/CD pipeline hooks
   - Team notification system
   - Security dashboard updates

<automation>
Automation workflow sequence:

1. Project Open Trigger:
   ```sequence
   Cursor->Environment: Check (100-environment-check.mdc)
   Environment->Tools: Verify security tools
   Tools->Config: Validate configurations
   Config->Workflow: Initialize audit process
   Workflow->Report: Generate initial status
   ```

2. File Change Trigger:
   ```sequence
   File->Static: Run static analysis
   Static->Dynamic: Trigger dynamic checks
   Dynamic->Rules: Apply security rules
   Rules->Report: Update findings
   Report->Notify: Send notifications
   ```

3. Periodic Checks:
   ```sequence
   Timer->Deps: Check dependencies
   Deps->Security: Verify security patches
   Security->Config: Validate settings
   Config->Report: Update status
   ```
</automation>

<rules>
1. Tool Integration Rules:
   - Semgrep must be configured with custom rules
   - SonarQube scanner must be available
   - OWASP dependency check must be enabled
   - Custom security tools must be registered

2. Process Rules:
   - All security checks must be automated
   - Reports must be generated after each scan
   - Findings must be categorized by severity
   - Each issue must have remediation guidance

3. Notification Rules:
   - Critical issues require immediate notification
   - Weekly summary reports must be generated
   - Team leads must be notified of new findings
   - Compliance status must be updated regularly

4. Documentation Rules:
   - All findings must be documented
   - Evidence must be collected and stored
   - Audit trail must be maintained
   - Remediation steps must be tracked
</rules>

<templates>
Templates are located in .cursor/rules/templates/:

4. Vulnerability Reports
   - Must include CVSS score
   - Must have clear PoC
   - Must suggest fixes
   - Must be verified
